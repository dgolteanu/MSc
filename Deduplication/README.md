# Deduplication of datasets was performed as described in thesis
Jupyter notebooks allow generation of csv file where every pair of columns is the removed fasta's header & associated classes, last cell shows duplicates with multiple classes **if present** and their counts.

Raw seqkit & notebook outputs cannot be uplaoded here as this would be publishing restricted data from the GISAID database and go against their terms of use (according to our interpretation). This may change in the future if/when clarification is requested from GISAID.  
See Lab book for details & files required to reproduce these results.
